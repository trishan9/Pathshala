## Problem Statement
Traditional academic management systems often rely on fragmented, manual, and paper-based workflows, leading to inefficiencies, human errors, and time-consuming processes. Teachers spend considerable time on non-teaching tasks, reducing their ability to focus on delivering quality education. Students struggle with accessing up-to-date learning materials and academic resources, hindering their educational progress. Administrators face difficulties in obtaining real-time data and actionable insights, making institutional performance monitoring less effective.
